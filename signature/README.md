This code deals with signatures based on hash functions.

1. Given a Python 3 script ver.py implementing the signature's verication algorithm,
the code implement the signing algorithm. In more detail, given a signing
key and verication key pair (in the les sk1 and vk1 )the program otputs two valid
signatures: one on my rst name and one on my last name. The signatures must be both
correct (pass verication) and secure. See Part 2 for an example of signatures that are correct
but not secure.

2. Given a verication key (in the le vk2 ) and 5 signatures: for x = a; b; c; d; e; the
signature on the message x is given in the le x.sig. The signatures are correct but not secure.
Your goal is nd the security 
aw and use it to sign your 9-digit ID. Your signature must
verify under vk2.
