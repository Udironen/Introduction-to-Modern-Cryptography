This code deals with signatures based on hash functions.

1. Given a Python 3 script ver.py implementing the signature's verification algorithm,
the code implement the signing algorithm. In more detail, given a signing
key and verifition key pair (in the files sk1 and vk1 ), the program outputs two valid
signatures: one on my first name and one on my last name. The signatures must be both
correct (pass verification) and secure. See Part 2 for an example of signatures that are correct
but not secure.

2. Given a verification key (in the file vk2 ) and 5 signatures: for x = a; b; c; d; e; the
signature on the message x is given in the file x.sig. The signatures are correct but not secure.
Your goal is find the security flaw and use it to sign  9-digit number. The signature must
verify under vk2.
